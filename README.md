## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to show my understanding of D3 and Javascript.

Using knowledge of HTML and JS, I created an SVG area. I used D3 to pull data from a .csv file.  I found the min and max of the chosen data for the x and y axis and scaled them appropriately.  I plotted a scattergram and labeled each node with the US state represented by the node.

### Dataset provided

.csv - U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System - 2014 ACS 

### Tools used

+1. Git Hub
+2. Python server
+3. JavaScript
+4. D3
+5. HTML
